This is an experiment to use [flake-parts](https://flake.parts) as an
organizational framework for building out the dev ecosystem. I have no idea if
it will prove useful. Everything in this directory pretends like it is at the
top level of a dev ecosystem repo (it is nested in this subdirectory to allow it
to coexist alongside the "home-grown" solution.)
