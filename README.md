# Dev Ecosystem

This is a proof-of-concept for a developer tool ecosystem monorepo, backed by Nix.

It uses [flake-parts](https://flake.parts) as an organizational framework for building out the dev ecosystem.

It contains various experiments for establishing conventions that could be used by an organization with varying degrees of familiarity with Nix.
